Your Trusted Partner for CO2 Certification
On the FAGRI.Digital platform, CO2 certification is built on a foundation of scientific rigour, cutting-edge technology, and robust legal compliance. We collaborate with leading institutions to ensure the highest standards and global recognition for your climate action initiatives.

Our Collaborative Framework
Our CO2 certification process operates under the EUFD2025-001 standard, developed over years of research with prominent Italian universities and our technology partner, ALPHAG8 Digital Solutions Switzerland. This standard is brought to life through strategic partnerships with:

European Commission: Aligning with overarching EU climate policies and goals.

Italian Ministry of Environment: Ensuring compliance with national environmental regulations.

GSE (Gestore dei Sistemi Energetici) in Italy: Integrating with established energy and emissions management frameworks.

ISO (International Organization for Standardization): Upholding globally recognized quality and procedural benchmarks.

UNI (Ente Italiano di Normazione): Ensuring national standardization and compatibility.

SUOLO E SALUTE: Our dedicated certification body for independent verification and validation of carbon credits.

Legal and Technological Basis
Our certification process is firmly rooted in a comprehensive legal and technological framework. We adhere strictly to, and often exceed, the requirements of:

EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS): Ensuring compliance with the cornerstone of EU climate policy.

Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM): Proactively addressing future reporting and embedded emissions requirements.

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) frameworks: Implementing stringent due diligence for all participants, including Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) and Source of Funds (SoF) verification, aligning with the latest EU AML legislation (AMLR, AMLD6).

Paris Agreement (Article 6): Supporting the mechanisms for International Transferrable Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) and the critical process of Corresponding Adjustments to prevent double-counting at a national level.

Kyoto Protocol: Building on established international accounting principles.

Furthermore, our platform leverages blockchain technology for immutable document storage, creating unparalleled transparency, eliminating issues like double counting and greenwashing, and ensuring clear ownership. Combined with a unique digital fingerprint for each user and Three-Factor Authentication (3FA), we provide an unparalleled secure and trustworthy environment for all your CO2 certification needs.
