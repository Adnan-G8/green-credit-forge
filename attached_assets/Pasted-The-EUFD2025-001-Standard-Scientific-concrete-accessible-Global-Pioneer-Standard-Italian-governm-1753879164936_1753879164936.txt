Pioneers from Italy to the World: Our Blockchain Standard for CO₂ Certificates
At FAGRI.Digital, we are proud to present our new innovative standard: EUFD2025-001. This standard is the result of years of intensive research and development, based on the latest scientific discoveries and created in close collaboration with leading Italian universities.

The FAGRI Digital platform that supports the EUFD2025-001 standard is designed to usher in a new era of trust, efficiency and transparency in CO₂ certification and trading — powered by blockchain technology, advanced data protection protocols and 3FA security architecture.

EUFD2025-001: Scientific, Transparent, Accessible and Secure with Blockchain
The EUFD2025-001 standard represents a groundbreaking approach to agricultural CO₂ certification, combining rigorous scientific methodology with cutting-edge blockchain technology. Developed through extensive collaboration with leading European research institutions and validated by independent certification bodies, this standard ensures that every carbon credit issued is scientifically sound, completely transparent, and legally compliant.

Our comprehensive framework addresses the growing need for standardized, verifiable carbon accounting in agriculture while maintaining the flexibility to accommodate diverse farming systems across Europe and beyond.

Blockchain Technology Integration
Double-Counting Prevention
Advanced cryptographic algorithms ensure each carbon credit can only be issued and traded once, eliminating fraud and double counting through immutable blockchain records.

Greenwashing Protection
Complete transparency through public blockchain verification allows stakeholders to independently verify the authenticity and environmental impact of every carbon credit.

Clear Ownership Verification
Smart contracts automatically establish and transfer ownership rights, providing legal certainty and reducing transaction costs in carbon credit markets.

Maximum Security Standards
Military-grade encryption and Swiss banking-level security protocols protect all data, ensuring confidentiality while maintaining transparency where required.
