## EUFD2025-001: Scientific, Transparent, Accessible, and Secure with Blockchain

**EUFD2025-001** is more than just a standard; it's a commitment to the highest levels of integrity, accessibility, and security. We developed it to simplify the complexities of CO2 certification, ensuring that **every individual and organization** committed to climate protection and with a rightful claim receives recognition for their efforts.

At the heart of our standard is the strategic use of **blockchain technology**. This creates unparalleled transparency and resolves critical issues within the carbon market:

* **Double counting is eliminated:** Every certificate is unique and immutable.
* **Greenwashing is prevented:** The entire value chain is transparent and traceable.
* **Clear ownership is ensured:** Digital entries are tamper-proof and permanent.

Additionally, a **unique digital fingerprint** for each user and the implementation of **Three-Factor Authentication (3FA)** ensure maximum protection for accounts and data across the FAGRI.Digital Ecosystem.

We work closely with key partners such as the **European Commission**, the **Italian Ministry of Environment**, **GSE**, **ISO**, **UNI**, and **SUOLO E SALUTE**. This guarantees unparalleled transparency and strict adherence to all relevant guidelines, while the global scalability of the standard has been considered from the outset.

**EUFD2025-001** is the **first step** into a new era of digitalization and support that FAGRI.Digital will extend into other important sectors beyond climate protection.
