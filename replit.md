## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- React 18 ecosystem (react, react-dom, @types/react)
- Vite build tooling with React plugin
- Express.js for backend server
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL driver

### UI and Styling
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Radix UI components for accessibility
- Lucide React for consistent iconography
- Class Variance Authority for component variants

### Data Management
- TanStack Query for server state and caching
- Zod for schema validation and type safety
- React Hook Form with Zod resolvers

### Development Tools
- TypeScript for type safety across the stack
- ESBuild for production bundling
- PostCSS with Autoprefixer for CSS processing

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. Frontend builds with Vite to `dist/public` directory
2. Backend builds with ESBuild to `dist` directory as ESM modules
3. Shared schema and types are included in both builds
4. Production build excludes development-only dependencies

### Environment Configuration
- Database URL required for PostgreSQL connection
- Drizzle migrations stored in `./migrations` directory
- Development mode includes Vite dev server integration
- Production serves static files from Express

### Hosting Requirements
- Node.js runtime for Express server
- PostgreSQL database (configured for Neon serverless)
- Static file serving capability for frontend assets
- Environment variable support for DATABASE_URL

### Development vs Production
- Development: Vite dev server with HMR, memory storage fallback
- Production: Compiled Express server, PostgreSQL database, static asset serving
- Shared configuration through environment variables and build scripts
